    <p>
    
   I'm currently studying for a 5-year degree at a business school and I'm passionate about innovation and experiences that allow me to surpass myself. After several rewarding experiences in the army, I decided to launch ‘Horizon Militaire’ to provide training advice such as sharing physical training routines, survival techniques, or preparation tips for joining the armed forces.
